				<h3>EZ reach Smart Delivery Service System</h3>
				
				<br />
				<p  >
						People were getting tired of explaining their location while they were ordering fast food or
						packages outside and inside of the city. 
					
			</p> <p>	Plus, there were some people that they never have had
						a chance to order something and get it by delivery service due to the hardness of location that
						might never be found by explaining, or the delivery man has never seen such a place. 
				</p>
				<p>Today,
						due to advanced technology EZ reach has found an ideal solution for those who were not able
						to order something, or for those who find difficulties in explaining the location. So, by using
						your phone number and register on EZ reach, you can order whatever you want from wherever
						you like, and it will be right in front of your house door. No more dozens of phone calls in order
						you explain your location to the delivery man. You will get whatever you like just by 2 phone
						calls, first call for order, second call for receipt.
